== *About the Practical Course / Workshop*

*Saturday, May 18, 2024 - Sunday, May 19, 2024* +
The use of a single reference genome in bioinformatics can lead to reference bias and miss important information about genome variability and relationships. New assembly methods have made it easier to generate high-quality complete genome assemblies, and using a pangenome graph that expresses many genomes and their mutual alignment can help address these issues.
This practical course / workshop will focus on building such graphs from whole genome assemblies and using them in various downstream applications in comparative genomics, evolution, variation analysis, sequence alignment, and phenotype association.

Participants will learn about pangenome concepts and gain practical experience building and analyzing pangenome graphs. They will apply these methods to complex research questions that require understanding the relationships between multiple genomes or accounting for variability when analyzing new genomes.
By the end of the practical course / workshop, participants will have a strong understanding of pangenome methods based on whole genome assemblies.

== *About the Conference*

*Monday, May 20, 2024* +
We will gather for an in-person conference on the day after the practical course / workshop.
This will bring together practical course / workshop participants and virtual and in-person speakers who are actively working on diverse aspects of pangenome research.
The virtual meeting will be open to the public.
Speakers will cover topics at the intersection of pangenome methods and biology, including a focus on basic methods, data structures, genome assembly, data visualization, and public collaborative pangenome projects.
We expect to draw speakers from a diverse set of species contexts.

== *About the Biohackathon*

*Tuesday, May 21, 2024 - Wednesday, May 22, 2024* +

We have a focus on software.
We will work with/on pangenomic tools (such as link:https://github.com/pangenome/pggb/[PGGB], link:https://github.com/waveygang/wfmash/[WFMASH], link:https://github.com/ekg/seqwish/[SEQWISH], link:https://github.com/pangenome/odgi/[ODGI], link:https://github.com/pangenome/smoothxg/[SMOOTHXG], link:https://github.com/vgteam/vg[VG], link:https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/[VCFLIB], link:https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/[GEMMA]) with software project leadership.

=== Practical Course / Workshop Instructors

==== Erik Garrison - Assistant Professor

.[purple]#University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, US#

image:images/erik.jpeg[erik,200,role="right"] Genomicist with a quantitative social science background. I build methods that let us understand the precise relationships between thousands of genomes. In these, the genome is encoded in a graph that may represent a population sample of individuals from the same species, a metagenome, the diploid genome of a single individual, or any other useful collection of sequences.

The cost includes all expenses associated with the event, with lunches, coffee, and snacks. In certain circumstances, we can waive the fees.

- Academic - $200, with financial support if needed
- Industry - $400

=== Selection criteria

This practical course / workshop is intended for biologists and bioinformaticians interested in studying organisms with high genetic diversity or without a reference genome, as well as those involved in comparative genomics and the assembly of pangenomes for any species.

Selection of participants will be based on:

- good knowledge of Linux operating system and basic shell commands. This will be a mandatory prerequisite.
- familiarity with genomics data formats (e.g., FASTA, VCF, BED, ...) is a plus.
- impact of the practical course / workshop for the participant and his/her research group.
- stage of the research project: priority will be given to participants with data already available and ready to be analyzed (participants data will not be analyzed during the practical course / workshop).

Fulfillment of these conditions by participants will be assessed through the registration form.
